My ~/.emacs.d
=====

I mainly use emacs for c, go kinda development.

External deps
-------------
[LLVM](http://clang.llvm.org/)
[irony-mode](https://github.com/Sarcasm/irony-mode)
[Cask](http://cask.github.io) 

Setup
------------
Once you have setup cask, run `cask install` in `~/.emacs.d` to install the from elpa.
then clone and install irony-mode in `~/.emacs.d/vendor/` and you should be good to go.
